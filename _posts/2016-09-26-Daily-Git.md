### Avoiding whitespace issues


git automatically warns about spaces at the end of a line. blank lines at the end of a file and spaces before tabs at the beginning of a line.

To get warnings about whitespace when you use `git diff`, add the following to your `.gitconfig` file:

```{.bash}
[core]
  whitespace = warn
```

Alternatively, execute the command to do exactly the same :

```{.bash}
$ git config --global core.whitespace warn
```

Now git will highlight the whitespace issues so you can fix them.


### Squashing commits

If you contribute to an open source project, e.g. by submitting a pull request with a bug fix, it should be presented as one unit of code.

You should `squash` your commits together. For example, if you have three commits:

```{.bash}
git reset HEAD~3
git add .
git commit -am "Fix bug #14"
git push --force
```

The `--force` option is needed if the commits have already been pushed, in order for them to be replaced. Beware that this overwrites previous hisotry so always avoid when possible.

By squashing you can get rid of `"fix typo"` commits and have all your changes grouped in just one commit. That will keep the maintainer happy!
