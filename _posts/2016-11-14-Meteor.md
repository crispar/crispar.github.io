noway to handle that. So I just reset meteor before running. It works. When there is any updated,
1. need to backup db data
2. reset meteor
3. run meteor and restore db data.


error handling

   While building for web.browser:
   error: no plugin found for accounts_ui.styl in ian:accounts-ui-bootstrap-3; a plugin for
   *.styl was active when it was published but none is now

Refer : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38678302/problems-with-stylus-on-meteor

meteor remove ian:accounts-ui-bootstrap-3
meteor remove accounts-password
meteor remove stylus

=> Need to install stylus as first.
meteor add stylus
meteor add ian:accounts-ui-bootstrap-3
meteor add accounts-password
